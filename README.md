# Day-Planner
Schedule important events in the business hours.

## Usage
For an employee with busy schedule, it is important to plan out the day, so that time can be used effectively.
This day planner provides hourly time slots, where you can log the activity you scheduled for that hour.
Click 'SAVE' to lock in your plan; and it will be visible to you even if you close and re-open the planner.
The time-slots are color-coded to indicate if the hour has passed, is current or is in the future.

The colors change automatically(after 15 secs of hour change), to reflect the current times, without having to refresh the page.
